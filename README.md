# My MPV Config

This is my custom configuration for [mpv](https://mpv.io/), a powerful media player. It's optimized for a clean look, smooth playback, and a good default experience.

You may want to tweak some options depending on your system, display, or personal preferences.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- You may want to adjust `alang`, `slang`, and interpolation settings to your own preferences.
- Caps Lock can interfere with key bindings that differentiate between lowercase and uppercase (e.g., `m` vs `M`).
- This setup avoids unnecessary complexity â€” but you can explore features like debanding, shaders if you want more.
- `sub-select` is recommended to auto-pick the best subtitle track. It's especially helpful when dealing with multiple sub streams like signs & songs vs full subs.

## ðŸ”§ Where to Put These

Place the following files in your mpv config folder:

- `mpv.conf` â†’ `~/.config/mpv` (Linux) or `%APPDATA%\mpv` (Windows)
- `input.conf` â†’ same location as above
- `sub-select.json` â†’ `~/.config/mpv/script-opts` (Linux) or `%APPDATA%\mpv\script-opts` (Windows)
